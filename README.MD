## Chord Spitter API 

Construct guitar chords from atomic tones. Use these chords to build chord sequences that can be formatted in lead sheet-style notation.
Learn harmonic concepts programmatically, compose songs, and let your creativity run wild!

This API can be used for other instruments, however some features (e.g. the chord diagrams) are guitar-specific.
